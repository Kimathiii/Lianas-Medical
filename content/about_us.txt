Lianas Medical Centre is a privately-owned low-cost community health center in Kangemi, Westlands Sub County, Nairobi County.

Started in 1998 as a small healthcare facility with less than 5 beds, Lianas has grown to a 20-bed hospital housed in a modern building with advanced treatment and diagnostic technologies.

We are one of the oldest and busiest medium-sized private hospitals in Westlands, offering both maternity and clinical services. In maternity alone, we have registered over 14,000 normal births since inception. We attend to over 15,000 patients annually.

As a private enterprise, we bring healthcare closer to local communities in a compassionate, dignified, and affordable way. The Social Health Authority (SHA) has contracted us to offer inpatient, outpatient, minor surgery, dental, and maternity services to all its members.
